# Medical Insurance Prediction

Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a Medical Insurance Prediction project! This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates my expertise in data analysis and machine learning by building a linear regression model to predict medical insurance charges. Using a dataset with features like age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region, I explored factors influencing insurance costs and developed a predictive model.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas to examine data distributions and smoker patterns across regions, revealing insights like the imbalance between smokers (564) and non-smokers (2208).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables (sex, smoker, region) using `LabelEncoder` for model compatibility.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and trained a linear regression model with scikit-learn, achieving a 74.5% accuracy score on test data.
- **Visualization**: Created a bar plot with Matplotlib to visualize smoker distribution by region, highlighting regional trends.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Leveraged Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and joblib for model persistence.

This project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. Explore the notebook to see the full workflow, from EDA to model evaluation, and feel free to reach out for questions or collaboration opportunities!
